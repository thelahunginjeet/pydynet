TODO:
-allow non-uniform amplitude exchanges, instead of always magnitude eps
-better integrators that handle threshold crossings
-more complicated reporting scheme for graph perturbations (report error code/reason for failure?)
-fix tests to run with extension modules
-get dependencies (i.e. networkx) into the setup file
